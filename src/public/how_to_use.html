        <h2>Hello, these are the functionalities of the site.</h2>

        <p>
            First make sure that you have prepared the correct project
            to be
            fully functional, you can check in the <a
                href="./documentation.html">documentation<a> section if
                    everything is
                    well prepared for use.
                </p>

                <p>After verifying that everything is according to the
                    documentation, let's see what we can do within this site</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        To bring data from the database you will need to
                        introduce yourself, you can access the <a
                            href="http://localhost:3000/register.html">register</a>
                        page
                        here after you finish reading
                    </li><br>
                    <li> You will be redirected to the log-in page where you
                        will
                        enter the previously created data in the register page
                        (if you have been here before, you can <a
                            href="http://localhost:3000/login.html">log in
                        </a>
                        directly)</li><br>
                    <li>
                        After the database knows you, you will be sent to the
                        main page
                    </li><br>

                    <li>The first section is to find out information about
                        animals, select the animal and the breed (you can choose
                        a random breed), press "Get Animal" and you will receive
                        the required information
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                        The second section is for you if you want to
                        increase the database. If you searched for a breed or
                        animal and it does not exist in the database, you can
                        add it yourself.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Write in the relevant fields the species and breed, add
                        the image and the database is ready to receive
                        information from you (you can search for the information
                        sent by you in the first section)</li><br>
                    <li>Now that you know what you can do, you can use the site
                        successfully</li>
                </ul>
